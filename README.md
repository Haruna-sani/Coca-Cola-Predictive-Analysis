# üìà Coca-Cola Stock Price Predictive Analysis using LSTM and CNN+GRU-LSTM

This project focuses on forecasting Coca-Cola stock prices using deep learning models ‚Äî LSTM and a hybrid CNN+GRU-LSTM architecture. The models are evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **R-squared (R¬≤)** metrics to determine prediction accuracy.

## üîç Objective

To develop accurate time-series prediction models for Coca-Cola stock prices by experimenting with different architectures, learning rates, and training configurations.
